Bioinformatics tools written in Perl
====================================

Most of the scripts here were written while I was working on different projects, which I think will be useful to others and can be extended / modified per there needs.

Most of the scripts written here use custom IO::Routine Perl Module. Please see the installation instructions by browsing the IO-Routine directory.
