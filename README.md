Bioinformatics tools written in Perl
====================================

IO::Routine [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/biocoder/Perl-for-Bioinformatics.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/biocoder/Perl-for-Bioinformatics)
----------------------------

Most of the scripts here were written while I was working on different projects, which I think will be useful to others and can be extended / modified per there needs.

The scripts use custom IO::Routine Perl Module. Please see the installation instructions by browsing the IO-Routine directory.

Cheers,

BioCoder
