Bioinformatics tools written in Perl 
====================================
Most of the scripts here were written while I was working on different projects, which I think will be useful to others and can be extended / modified per there needs.

IO::Routine [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/biocoder/Perl-for-Bioinformatics.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/biocoder/Perl-for-Bioinformatics)
----------------------------
The scripts use custom [IO::Routine](https://github.com/biocoder/Perl-for-Bioinformatics/tree/master/IO-Routine) Perl Module. 

Please see the installation instructions by browsing the [IO::Routine](https://github.com/biocoder/Perl-for-Bioinformatics/tree/master/IO-Routine) directory.

ncRNAScan [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/biocoder/Perl-for-Bioinformatics.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/biocoder/Perl-for-Bioinformatics)
--------------------------
A pipeline to extract putative novel ncRNAs ab initio, given a list of transcripts in GTF format assembled from deep sequencing data (ex: RNA-Seq).

Head on to [NGS-Utils](https://github.com/biocoder/Perl-for-Bioinformatics/tree/master/NGS-Utils) directory for script list.

See `perl ncRNAScan -h` or `perldoc ncRNAScan` for complete description.
