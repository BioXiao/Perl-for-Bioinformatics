# Specify output directory.
# In the example below, a  new output directory called "lncRNApipe_test"
# will be created at the mentioned path /Users/krantikonganti/Projects/scratch_test.

#
# Let lncRNApipe know if you intend to perform transcript assembly
# using tophat / cufflinks or just identify ncRNAs from already

performTranscriptAssembly: YES

#
# Specify number of threads / CPUs to use where possible.
# If running on a grid, each job script will run with this many

CPUs: 4

#
# Specify scheduler type.
# Valid options are PBS, SGE, LSF or NONE to disable grid computing.

scheduler: LSF

# Mention batch submission command.
# For example, for LSF, it is bsub, for PBS or SGE, it

batchSubCmd: bsub

# Specify scheduler options on separate line

# ********************* !! IMPORTANT !! ***********************

#
# Different clusters uses different job parameter names. For
# example our cluster uses num_threads as parameter name to
# request number of CPUs in SGE. Some clusters may use
# num_cpu. Since it is difficult to guess, please provide
# number of CPUs you want to use based on your grid environment
# below, which is equal to "CPUs:" option above. Yes, we know that
# this is kind of redundant but it is necessary evil. What ever
# job parameters you provide after the - , they will appear
# exactly in the job script.
#
# IF IT IS NOT PROVIDED, THE JOB WILL RUN ON SINGLE CPU.

#
# Specify if your reads are SE (single-end only), PE (paired-end only) or MIXED
#
libType: MIXED

#
# Specify if you want to use ENSEMBL or UCSC as source for annotation.
# "PLEASE MAKE SURE" that you are using the same sourceDB for tophat
# alignment, i.e. bowtie indexes created from the same sourceDB for the
# same assembly version. As downloding genome indices on-the-fly is time
# consuming and since many users may have genome indices installed for
# various NGS analysis anyways, we leave it to you to provide "CORRECT"
# genome index below in tophat and cufflinks options' configuration.
#
sourceDB: UCSC

#
# Choose assembly version so that we can download up-to-date annotation on the fly.
# You can choose to supply your own annotation file for consistency below.
# ENSEMBL and UCSC represents species name differently in the URLs.
# To view species names for ENSEMBL do, "perl lncRNApipe --list ENSEMBL".
# Go to https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQreleases.html#TOP to view UCSC version names.
# For example, at UCSC, for mouse, it is mm9 or mm9, for rat, it is rn5 or rn6 etc...
#
species: rn4

#
# If you want to use your own annoation file, provide full path to the annotation
# file of your choice. This option overrides "sourceDB: " and "species: " options above.
# Again, "PLEASE MAKE SURE", you are providing the same genome index from the
# same source. In the example below, "bowtieGenomeIndex" is mm9 genome index created
# from FASTA files from UCSC.

#
# PLEASE MAKE SURE THE READS ARE IN ORDER. DO NOT MIX AND MATCH READ ORDERS.
# WE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING WHICH READ FILE IS _1 or _2.
